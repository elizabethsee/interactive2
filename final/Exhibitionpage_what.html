    <div class="about">
      <p>“An exhibition in form” features three of Kelly’s pieces in an interactive sense whereby the focus is the texture and the materiality of Kelly’s sculptures.</p>

  <!-- <div class="about">
    <p>After early artistic training in New York and Boston and military service in World War II, Ellsworth Kelly spent a formative period in France from 1948 to 1954. It was there that he developed his characteristic work. These abstractions drastically reduce glimpsed details of the world into the sparest of arrangements. The resulting forms are neither representational nor precisely geometric. He also explored chance as a compositional technique, and eliminated any visible brushwork from his solid color fields.</p>
