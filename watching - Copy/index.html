<!--" Sometimes, however, the best way to hide something is not hiding at all. Or, sometimes, one can provide misleading information to conceal the very fact that something is hidden. Therefore, the art of surveillance and control is how to manage the visible and the invisible; it is a game of revealing and hiding, knowledge and deception. If there is something like the existing regime of surveillance, it must be based on a certain relationship between two terms. To subvert it and win the game, one should be able to understand the relationship and play upon it... " - Min Choi-->
